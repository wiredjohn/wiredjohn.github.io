*Overclocked: An Archive of Graphics Card Box Art* is exactly what it says it is. When I first found this I was very excited and almost bought it immediately. 

Thankfully I didn't because the book is *tiny* and the images inside are made even smaller by a black border on every page. Disappointing because this had the potential to be something very cool. GPU box art has always been a fascinating phenomenon to me since childhood.
