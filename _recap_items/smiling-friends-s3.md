Watched the new season of Smiling Friends, it's fantastic. Episode 7 was my favourite. 

Not a complaint about the show, but the UK distribution is absolutely shameful. The new season came out in October last year and now, 4 months later, there's still no official channel to watch it. The previous seasons were on Channel 4 but season 3 isn't and the old seasons have been removed, you can **BUY** seasons 1 and 2 on Amazon but not 3 and Adult Swim itself isn't available in the UK. Pure joke.

Go watch it. It's worth flying to a licensed region to watch on network television which is totally what I did.
