I saw this sticker at a bus stop in Glasgow. I think it's a really clever advertisement. I know exactly what's on offer and how to get it in as few as 4 (3 + 2 half) letters.

Sometimes that's all you need.

I tried to identify the original designer but it seems to be a common and reused concept in this particular industry. Lots of people are selling this exact design on RedBubble.
