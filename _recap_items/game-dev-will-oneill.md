Will O'Neill is an indie game developer and creator of [Actual Sunlight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/288040/Actual_Sunlight/). I played this game when I was a teenager and found it really inspiring to see a narrative-driven game made with RPGMaker. Made me question what a game could be. 

He's still making games and wrote for [Superliminal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1049410/Superliminal/), another game I enjoyed.
