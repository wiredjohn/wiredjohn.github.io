While browsing fonts I discovered this guy [GGBOTNET](https://www.ggbot.net/), a game designer who makes free fonts. They've made over 100 fonts that are freely available under open licenses. 

I think it's very impressive that a single person has produced so much work and then allows everyone else to benefit from their efforts. One of their fonts was even used in an official [Ariana Grande lyric video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG7w56PyTmU&list=PLZM8OwN06-LFv80BuVdPm-fZvMD8-0gAj&index=12).

Go check out their work on [itch.io](https://ggbot.itch.io/), they've also made [videos showing their font design process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIjVFHf2xFE&list=PLZM8OwN06-LFQi0mfhJblQeskucK-dCRt).
