[JRH](https://www.youtube.com/@jack.hodkinson) made a great YouTube video explaining how the Street Fighter 2 developers fixed a spelling mistake on the game title screen using a character's leg sprite. Proper interesting watch. 

He also linked some good references for old game dev info and developer interviews:
