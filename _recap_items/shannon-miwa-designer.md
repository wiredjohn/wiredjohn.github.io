Found this designer through their monospaced redesign of Comic Sans, [Comic Shanns](https://github.com/shannpersand/comic-shanns), which is pretty neat but I personally wouldn't use it in my day-to-day life. 

Originally I was only going to showcase this font, but then I found their porfolio website [www.onehorse.town](https://onehorse.town/) and had to talk about it. The whole site is themed around a restaurant using menus and receipts. The site appears to be a single page with naviagtion links that rotate sections in and out of frame. All content is rotated ~10 degrees which creates a nauseating effect when scrolling. Never seen anything like this before.
