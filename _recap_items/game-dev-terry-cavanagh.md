Terry Cavanagh is the creator of a number of hit games, including [Super Hexagon](https://superhexagon.com/) which was insanely popular when I was in high school.

Amazingly he released the souce code to his game [VVVVVV](https://thelettervsixtim.es/) on [GitHub](https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV). What a cool guy!

I've had some fun playing his latest game [Egg](https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/egg). Go check it out.
