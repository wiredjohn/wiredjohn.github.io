The website of a designer specialising in Y2K/futuristic visuals.

Their portfolio and showreel show off some really cool stuff, my favourites being the fonts [Ultra Hi-Gloss](https://itemlabel.com/products/ultra-hi-gloss-font) and [Fantasma](https://github.com/froyotam/Fantasma), the latter being open source and extra cool.
