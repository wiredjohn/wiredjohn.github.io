Timothy Cain is a game developer, mostly known for creating Fallout. He has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CainOnGames) where he talks about game design and the projects he's worked on.

I think he's an absolute joy listen to. 

The most interesting video I've seen so far is [My Colorblindness and Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHUAFYDzN3U) - where he discusses how being colorblind affects how he makes & plays video games and what design decisions make things accessible to him and others.
