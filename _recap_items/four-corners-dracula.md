Picked up this beautiful edition of Bram Stoker's Dracula as a Christmas present for my girlfriend. 

Designed by [John Morgan](https://morganstudio.co.uk/), who sadly passed away this year - he has given each character their own appropriate typeface. The book binding itself pays tribute to the original UK first edition. 

I'm probably a little too excited to have a read considering it's a gift...

UPDATE: she loved it.
