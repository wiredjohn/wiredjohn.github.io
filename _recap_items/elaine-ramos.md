Elaine Ramos is a Brazilian designer whose work was showcased in <a href="/2025/11/11/thinking-with-type-by-ellen-lupton">Thinking With Type</a>. Their portfolio website is built with [Cargo](https://cargo.site/).

I can't find the exact work from the book online, but it was from their [Mirada](https://elaineramos-estudiografico.com.br/Mirada) project. 

How they use margins, whitespace and rules to break up or wrap blocks of text really appeals to me. Everything feels so uniform and balanced despite the layouts being so ununifom(?) - that feels like what I'm trying to say.

The below image is from their project *[Elza: a mulher do fim do mundo](https://elaineramos-estudiografico.com.br/Elza-a-mulher-do-fim-do-mundo)*.
