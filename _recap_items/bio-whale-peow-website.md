[Peow2](https://peow.studio) is a publisher of (mostly) books. Their website is really stand-out in structure, style and design. 

Found them because of Bio-Whale by Ville Kallio. Peow2s product pages feature in-your-face imagery, interactable 3D models of the books and custom colours themed to the product. Very stunning and unique pages overall, this is how I'd want my book to be marketed (if I had one). 

Only complaint, and it's a biggie: product pages have no price info or function to buy/add to basket. I'm on your beautiful page and you've convinced me to buy the product, LET ME GIVE YOU MY MONEY! To actually buy things you need to go to the [product list](https://peow.studio/shop/int).
