A type foundry from France. I haven't had a close look at their fonts, but their website is phenominal. Things are animated and they spin - you know how much I like that.

I've included a screenshot below but it simply doesn't do the site justice. Go check it out: [plombtype.com](https://plombtype.com)

Little aside - one of the designers has a cool personal site that's just a wall of text. The website is what it needs to be, and it does it well. Found them through the Goole Fonts GitHub repo: [emmamarichal.fr](https://emmamarichal.fr/).
