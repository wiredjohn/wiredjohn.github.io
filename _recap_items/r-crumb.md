This month I went down a Robert Crumb-shaped rabbit hole from which I've emerged. Can't call myself a fan of him or the majority of his work, but I did find some things of his that I really enjoy. 

He illustrated the cover of *Cheap Thrills* by *Big Brother and the Holding Company*, the title text I like a lot.

If you're interested in him then I would recommend watching [Crumb (1994) on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2_SXKWa4mY), a documentary about the man, his work and his family - or visit his official website [crumbproducts.com](https://crumbproducts.com).

A lot of his illustartions are notable but I particularly like this one.
