Not only did I find a font that I really like, the webpage is **phenominal**. 

[Fit](https://djr.com/fit/) is a bold, in-your-face font designed to occupy as much available space as possible. The font is presented exceptionally well on [David Jonothan Ross' website](https://djr.com). The striking, imposing and authoritarian feel of the page reinforces what this font is all about.

*Chris Lewis* is credited with the design of the page but it looks like their website is expired so I won't link it here.
