Neat type style here. Super simple web page that's just a list of links, but they've applied `transform: scaleY(3);` to everything to stretch the text out vertically. It's ugly, hard to read and scaling text rather than changing the font size is just bad - but I've never seen this done before and I think it's visually cool.

I should note that I don't know who this person is or what they do. [Their website](https://himerathreetimes.github.io/normal.html) has a lot of external links to stuff I haven't vetted - basically I'm not endorsing anything you find on there. Thinking I should put a disclaimer like this on all monthly recaps&hellip;
