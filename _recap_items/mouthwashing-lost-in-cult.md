Lost In Cult are producing a design works book for the video game [Mouthwashing](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475490/Mouthwashing/). Haven't played the game myself but I watched someone play it when it came out. 

Very visually appealing game, perfect candidate for an art book like this. 

Not sure if I can justify &pound;50 + a 12-14 month wait for a book though.
