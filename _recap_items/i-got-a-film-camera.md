My girlfriend got me an old film camera so I've been having some fun learning to use it. Had to wait a while to identify and order missing parts from eBay, but eventually got a roll of film loaded. 

It's a different experience not being able to immediately see what you've captured. It makes me not care too much about trying because I have no idea if what I'm doing is what I think is good.

As expected most of the roll was spent trying to figure out how the camera works but I did get a couple of nice ones. Here's my favorite.
