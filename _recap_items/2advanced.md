I know I'm mega late to the party, but 2advanced are new to me. 

From their [gallery on Web Design Museum](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/exhibitions/2advanced-studios): *At the turn of the millennium, 2Advanced Studios was synonymous with the highest quality creative flash sites. Even today's web designers still admire the timelessness and distinctive design of 2Advanced websites.*

Web Design Museum also have a [playlist of 2advanced animations on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHbQmqmmIFk&list=PL1a9Qk9koD83RQ5EvcYCGy2SZAGmYDzh_).

All their work is so refreshingly different for the time and even 25+ years later, it's fantastic. 

Also their (I think former) creative director, [Shane Mielke](https://www.shanemielke.com/) has an absolutely insane portfolio. He's written a couple of books on design that I've added to my reading list.
