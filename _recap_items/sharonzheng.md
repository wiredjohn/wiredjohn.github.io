Sharon Zheng is a creative technologist using the web and digital mediums to make art. They have a [full list of projects on GitHub](https://github.com/skinsshark/skinsshark.github.io/blob/master/README.md). One of which I especially like is [inner-self-portrait](https://inner-self-portrait.vercel.app/), which was built with/based on the work of [Stefanie Posavec](https://www.stefanieposavec.com/).

However I'm showcasing them here because their website is SICK. Sick nasty. Makes me want to quit my job and live in the woods levels of disgustingly good. Honestly this might be my *Website of the Year*.
