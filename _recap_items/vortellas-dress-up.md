An interesting blog post about the development of a browser-based "dress up" game. 

This opened my eyes to a number of things: 
- Web games are still a thing?
- [poki.com](https://poki.com) - massive platform for playing online games
- [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/) - framework for creating online games/animations/visuals

I found it pretty inspiring to read the dev's story, quitting their 9 to 5 to do game development full time in the process. 

[V1 Digital](https://v1digital.com/) are very open about their development process and have written [other blog posts](https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/vortellis-pizza-a-3d-multiplayer-kitchen-sim/28322) that go into more technical details about making multiplayer online games.

Very curious what revenue looks like after 170 million plays, but I don't expect anyone to disclose this.
