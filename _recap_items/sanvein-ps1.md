Remembered that the PlayStation 1 game Sanvein was a thing. I loved this game, if I can get my hands on my old PS1 then I'll be playing this again.

The UI is so loud and fast and in your face as you play. It's constant. Your life in the game is measured in time, it constantly ticks down and you lose more time as you take damage. The interface of the game screams at you "TIME IS RUNNING OUT" every moment you play.

I might make time to do an actual write-up of the visual elements of Sanvein if I get around to playing it again.
