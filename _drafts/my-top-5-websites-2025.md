Is it too late to still be talking about last year? Maybe it is, but I felt like pulling together a list of my top 5 website designs from 2025.  

This isn't anything serious so don't expect a trophy or anything. My criteria for consideration is:
- I found the website in 2025 (it wasn't necessarily created then)
- I like it
