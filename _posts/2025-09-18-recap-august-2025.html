<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the August 2025 recap, arriving well later than it should be.
</p>
<p>
    I plan to make this a new regular feature where I talk about the things I've been looking into for the past month. This will 1) allow me to share some cool stuff and 2) consolodate this cool stuff so that I can find it myself instead of trying to find the .txt file I saved a link to in 6 months time.
</p>

<p>
    In August I read about traditional artists and started drawing again, found some cool graphic design tools, started learning Figma, began learning about typography and started playing the video game Psycho Patrol R.
</p>

<p>
    I also quit vaping, but more on that at a future date.
