    This month I finished reading <a href="/2025/11/11/thinking-with-type-by-ellen-lupton">Thinking With Type</a>, I rebuilt the structure of these monthly recap posts (posts were breaking between columns which looked bad, so had to overhaul how I write these posts) and I tried to make a bitmap font.
