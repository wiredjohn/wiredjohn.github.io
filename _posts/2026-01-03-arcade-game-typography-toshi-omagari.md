I just finished reading *Arcade Game Typography* by [Toshi Omagari](https://tosche.net/non-fonts/arcade-game-typography) and really want to talk about it. 


## Overview

The book catalogs and categorises a large selection of arcade game typefaces, specifically 8x8 pixel monospace fonts. It's grouped into sections based on type classification (e.g. serif, sans bold, slanted) and features essays that delve deeper into the history, technical limitations and cultural influences that created these typefaces. 

Omagari's writing is informative, punchy and full of character. His assessment of each typeface is insightful and fun to read. His passion about the top shines through the text.

Because of the succinct analysis of each typeface, you can treat it like a coffee-table book; flicking through to an appealing section then putting it back down again. Or you can read it sequentially, as I did, without feeling like it drags on too much. 

The book itself is presented beautifully. I'm a big fan of the visible grid layout used throughout. The character sets for each font are crisp and perfectly legible, you can really see every pixel in each example. I'm not too sure who's responsible for what elements, but [Leo Field](https://leofield.co.uk/Arcade-Game-Typography) is credited with design and [Darren Wall](https://darrenwall.co/arcade-game-typography) is credited with art direction. 




## My favourite stuff

Usually I'd try to talk about the things I liked and follow up with some things I didn't enjoy so much, but I don't really have any complaints about this book.

Instead I will simply list off my favourite things.


### It made me laugh

A number of times this book had me laughing. Two examples spring to mind: When talking about the game *Son of Phoenix* (PAGE 25), Omagri makes a point to highlight nonsensical game text that's so ridiculous I was thinking about "hamburgers and mom" for days. And a line from his analysis of *TAISEN MAHJONG FINAL ROMANCE 4* really caught me off guard:
<blockquote>&ldquo;In the late 90s, online arcade play became commonplace, and players could finally enjoy a game of pornographic Mahjong agains other real-life human opponents&rdquo;</blockquote>


### It showcased a lot of cool typefaces

Should come as no surprise that arcade game developers came out with some awesome font designs and Omagari does a fantastic job showing them off. Here's the standouts to me.

<p>
	<strong>XEVIOUS: PAGE 048</strong><br />
	Cool Sci-Fi semi-bold typeface.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>AFTER BURNER: PAGE 062</strong><br />
	Very cool stylised font, I especially like the lowercase "i". It was inspired by the classic typeface "Stop".
</p>
<p>
	<strong>DYNAMITE DUX: PAGE 158</strong><br />
	Interesting bold caps and delicate lowercase. I love the contrast between the 2 cases and they both look great independently too.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>DARK SEAL: PAGE 159</strong><br />
	Slanted caps and upright lowercase. The game itself has a style that appeals to me even if it is a bit weird and jarring.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>TAKEDA SHINGEN: PAGE 252</strong><br />
	Drop-shadow/pillar of the font is taller at the top and shorter towards the screen, creating this cool perception of depth. Omagari described it as "a shiny metallic extrusion with differing heights, as if the letter is slanted forward, or the pillar of the letterform is sliced diagonally."
</p>

Maybe my favourite-of-favourites were **ROAD RIOT 4WD: PAGE 038** and especially **DOUBLE AXLE: PAGE 113**. These are metallic chrome designs which look sick. I have a Pantera shirt with a similar type design. I didn't realise how much I liked this chrome effect or how successful this can look in pixel art. I may experiment with recreating this effect for the modern web at some point. 

The "A" from DOUBLE AXEL is featured on the cover of the hardback edition published by Read-Only Memory.

### I learned about some cool stuff

Handful of cool, miscellaneous things I learned too:
<p>
	<strong>MICR Typefaces: PAGE 130</strong><br />
	Magnetic Ink Character Recognition is a printing technology invented in the 50's. It's a mechanical numberic typeface designed to be read by both humans and magnetic scanners. I've never heard of MICR, didn't know this was a thing and it was cool to read about.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>BLADES OF STEEL: PAGE 243</strong><br />
	Typefaces designed with the same constraints as a digital clock, never seen this done before either. See also FLAK ATTACK: PAGE 245.
</p>

**PRIMAL RAGE: PAGE 259** <br />
Had my eyes opened to Primal Rage for the first time. Absolutely nothing to do with typography, this games just looks awesome. The interface is sick and the characters are stop-motion animated - everything about the game looks cool. 

Found a quick [Making-of Primal Rage YouTube video from 1994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=132yf17fiHc).

### My favourite part
*ALL CHARACTERS IN A GAME* (page 218) may be my favourite section.

Here Omagari showcases and all the different typefaces and character sets used in two games, *Blockade* and *Outrun*. 

The focus shifts from a single 8x8 pixel monospace font to all the type within a game.

I loved seeing the full use of type and how each typeface has a purpose, as well as the technical workarounds that developers had to implement to make the most of resources. 

I would read a full book of just this.


## Conclusion
*Arcade Game Typography* is a charming and insightful read. It sheds light on a setting where typography was being pioneered by outsider artists working under technical limitations never before seen. 

Omagari's knowlege is impressive and his passion is contagious.

Definitely made for a niche audience, but anyone interested in type design, pixel art or video games will find wisdom or inspiration from reading this.

Go check it out.
