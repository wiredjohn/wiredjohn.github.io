## Intro
Finally, I've posted a monthly recap on time!

This month I've been thinking about video games more than usual. I've always wanted to make a game and I've had a project on the back-burner for a while now, I might be motivated to devote more time to it.

I did a bit of [experimenting with vertical text](/2025/10/20/experimenting-with-vertical-text) and (as always) I looked at some cool fonts. 

I also redesigned these recap pages form a single column layout on desktop to a 3 column newspaper style layout. I don't know how pleasant an experience it is, but I like it for now. I need to figure out a way of preventing breaks after section headers without completely reformatting the post markdown. 

Other updates: removed breadcrumb navigation from all pages (because the links to /home and /blog are 10 pixels above it in the header duhhh) and added post navigation to the bottom of each post (i.e. previous and next post links).


## Designer: froyotam.info
[froyotam.info](https://www.froyotam.info) is the website of a designer specialising in Y2K/futuristic visuals.

Their portfolio and showreel show off some really cool stuff, my favourites being the fonts [Ultra Hi-Gloss](https://itemlabel.com/products/ultra-hi-gloss-font) and [Fantasma](https://github.com/froyotam/Fantasma), the latter being open source and extra cool.

## Website: Plomb Type
[Plomb Type](https://plombtype.com) is a type foundry from France. I haven't had a close look at their fonts, but their website is phenominal. Things are animated and they spin - you know how much I like that.

I've included a screenshot below but it simply doesn't do the site justice. Go check it out: [plombtype.com](https://plombtype.com)

Little aside - one of the designers has a cool personal site that's just a wall of text. The website is what it needs to be, and it does it well. Found them through the Goole Fonts GitHub repo: [emmamarichal.fr](https://emmamarichal.fr/).



## Web Designer: interno9
Found this cool web designer/developer, they have a really interesting and impressive portfolio. I especially like their use of canvas to create 3D partical background and hover elements on their project [onfinance.ch](https://onfinance.ch/).

## Mouthwashing Design Works by Lost In Cult
Lost In Cult are producing a design works book for the video game [Mouthwashing](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475490/Mouthwashing/). Haven't played the game myself but I watched someone play it when it came out. 

Very visually appealing game, perfect candidate for an art book like this. 

Not sure if I can justify &pound;50 + a 12-14 month wait for a book though. 

Check out the [Mouthwashing design works pre-order](https://www.lostincult.co.uk/mouthwashing).

## Sanvein
Remembered that the PlayStation 1 game Sanvein was a thing. I loved this game, if I can get my hands on my old PS1 then I'll be playing this again.

The UI is so loud and fast and in your face as you play. It's constant. Your life in the game is measured in time, it constantly ticks down and you lose more time as you take damage. The interface of the game screams at you "TIME IS RUNNING OUT" every moment you play.

I might make time to do an actual write-up of the visual elements of Sanvein if I get around to playing it again.

## I Read Emigre Magazine #58
The cover of this magazine caught my eye - I think it's so sick. Big text, high contrast and bold colours are things I really like and that's what the entirety of this issue is. 

Aside from the cover, my favourite parts are "100 seconds" and "One Planet. One Network. One Leader".
