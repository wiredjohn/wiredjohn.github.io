<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
    Finally, I've posted a monthly recap on time!
</p>
<p>
    This month I've been thinking about video games more than usual. I've always wanted to make a game and I've had a project on the back-burner for a while now, I might be motivated to devote more time to it.
</p>
<p>
    I did a bit of <a href="/2025/10/20/experimenting-with-vertical-text">experimenting with vertical text</a> and (as always) I looked at some cool fonts.
</p>
<p>
    I also redesigned these recap pages form a single column layout on desktop to a 3 column newspaper style layout. I don't know how pleasant an experience it is, but I like it for now. I need to figure out a way of preventing breaks after section headers without completely reformatting the post markdown.
</p>
<p>
    Other updates: removed breadcrumb navigation from all pages (because the links to /home and /blog are 10 pixels above it in the header duhhh) and added post navigation to the bottom of each post (i.e. previous and next post links).
</p>
