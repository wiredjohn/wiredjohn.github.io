<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
    Merry Christmas &amp; Happy New Year Everyone!
</p>
<p>
    It's been a nice month and I've been enjoying a bit of time off work with the family. I've spent most of my free time looking at cool books and websites and planning out some projects I'd like to get stuck into in the new year.
