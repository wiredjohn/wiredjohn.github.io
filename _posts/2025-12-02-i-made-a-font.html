    I mentioned in my <a href="/2025/11/30/recap-november-2025">November 2025 recap</a> that I found a bitmap font editor: <a href="https://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2" target="_blank">BITFONTMAKER2</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I immediately wanted to make something with it. I've dabbled with other font editors but nothing comes close to how simple this is.
</p>
<p>
    So here it is:
</p>

<p class="jblock display">
    JBLOCK!
</p>

<p>
    <a href="#Demo">Go to a full font-demo</a>.
</p>

<p>
    JBLOCK is a 14x14 pixel, uppercase only, monospace font. 
</p>

<p>
    The intention when designing this was to make each character occupy as much space as possible while still being recognisable. I started off with a 13x10 pixel rectangle in the editor and deleted pixels to create each glyph. 
</p>

<p>
    There are a number of technical and practical limitations with this font:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>It only has uppercase characters, lowercase letters are duplicates of the uppercase</li>
    <li>There are no ascenders or descenders, with the exception of a couple of special characters that creep slightly past the baseline and x-height</li>
    <li>Only basic Latin characters are supported</li>
    <li>I'm not satisfied with the numerals, it's not clear that some of them aren't letters. Specifically '2' looks like 'Z'</li>
    <li>Very illegible and not suitable for longer blocks of text. Minimum readable size is about 24px</li>
</ul>

<p>But above all, it's a pain to read. </p>

<p>This was a fun little challenge for myself. I have no intention to actually use this for anything, but feel free to download the .ttf if you want it.</p>

<p class="jblock text-center">&#x263A;</p>

<p>Side-quest within a side-quest: I made a little script to demo fonts when making this page. This is what you see at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>You simply tell the script what container to append elements to, the name of your font-family and the base font-size.</p>

<p>The demo script takes care of the rest, creating elements to showcase the font at different sizes, the full character set and how the font reads in a bigger block.</p>

<p>I might refine this some more and write a dedicated post on it.</p>

<p>
    Edit 04/12/2025: noticed that iOS Safari didn't like my .ttf - generated and included .woff and .woff2 formats using <a href="https://transfonter.org/">transfonter</a>.
