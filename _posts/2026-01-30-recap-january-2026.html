<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
    This month has been full of inspiration and motivation. I've been listening to advice from game developers and reading about their processes, which has led me to put time into my game project that's been neglected for a while. This year I'd really like to make progress on it. Current objective is designing the UI in Figma. I might start writing devlog blog posts once I get into the build.
</p>
<p>
    I've also taken on a project to make a Shopify site for someone. I've been having fun getting the hang of the Shopify ecosystem and workflow, the tech behind it all is pretty incredible. I'll post about this project when it's done.
</p>
<p>It's been a good month.</p>
