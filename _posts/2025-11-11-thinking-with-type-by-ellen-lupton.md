I recently read [Thinking With Type](https://ellenlupton.com/Thinking-with-Type) by [Ellen Lupton](https://ellenlupton.com) - the book that everyone recommends when you ask for a typography book recommendation. 

Having no education or training when it comes to design, I'm open to read anything. I'm going to give my opinion of this textbook from the perspective of someone who knew little-to-nothing about the intricacies of type. 

## In Short:
- I liked it
- I learned a fair bit
- I would recommend it to someone who wants to begin learning about type

## In Longer:
I feel like I got a lot out of reading this book. Lupton assumes nothing of the reader and does a good job of holding your hand through each concept. The hand-holding extends to even the subject of letters and language themselves: with detailed introductions into the history of language, letterforms, caligraphy and lettering, printing and finally the advent of digital typography. 

A strong foundation is layed to support the reader in understanding the ideas introduced later in the book. 

The book itself is presented well. Each concept typically spans 1 page spread (2 pages side by side) so the information is easily digestable. Examples are included everywhere to give a theoretical explaination of an idea along with an example of real-world application. 

The punchiness of concepts was very useful, allowing me to read 1 or 2 when I found a gap in a busy day.

There are also some design exercises, which I've yet to try out, that look quite fun. 

## Key Takeaways
For me personally, the biggest things I've taken from this book are:
- Finding out what all the keywords and buzzwords I keep seeing about text actually mean
- Better understanding of hierarchy in a layout
- How to find fonts that go together
- How to space, size and group text elements in a logical way 

This book also spoke about "the grid", which I think will be the next thing I read about. I'll probably pick up Grid Systems: Principles of Organizing Type. 

So again, I would recommend this book to anyone looking to get an understanding of how type is used in design. I believe the purpose of this book is to start shifting your perspective to see the sheer significance of type and text, hence "thinking with type". For a new designer this book can be a valuable tool to start this shift, but maybe a more seasoned designer won't have too much to gain from reading it.
