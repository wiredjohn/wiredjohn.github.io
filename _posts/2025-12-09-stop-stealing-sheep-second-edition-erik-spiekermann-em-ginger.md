 I recently read *Stop Stealing Sheep & find out how type works* by Erik Spiekermann & E.M. Ginger. I'll share what I thought of it here. 

 Before I begin I need to admit to a mistake: I read the **second edition**, not realising that there was a **fourth edition** [freely available on Google Fonts](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/fonts.google.com/en//knowledge/stop_stealing_sheep.pdf). 

 Now I haven't read the fourth edition, but from skimming the contents it looks like any complaints I could have had about the content being dated have been shut down. Makes sense given there's 19 years between the release of these editions. 

 Go read the fourth edition if you're interested - I will share my thoughts on the second edition (should still apply to the newer version). 


## Overview
*Stop Stealing Sheep & find out how type works* is a casual and conversational introduction to typography. The seemingly insane title is a reference to a quote by Frederic Goudy that gets explained as you read the text. 

I bought this book for &pound;1.30 from Amazon but, as already mentioned, you can read the latest edition for free online. Whether you're paying &pound;2 or &pound;0, I think this book is well worth the investment.


## Layout and Structure
Much like [Thinking with Type by Ellen Lupton](/2025/11/11/thinking-with-type-by-ellen-lupton), each topic or concept is contained within a single page spread. The left page contains a full spread image to demonstrate the concept being discussed. The right-hand page contains the real info. Information is split between body copy, side-bar commentary and examples of typefaces to futher explain the topic. 

It's a very digestible format. I found it very easy to read a page or 2, put the book down and pick back up when I found another moment later in the day. 

The text is split into chapters that logically group the topics. E.g. the chapter "Type is Everywhere" showcases typography in our everyday lives and how it's used to serve a purpose. 


## My Favourites
I liked a lot about this book. 

The tone and language throughout is casual and often funny. For example, on page 21 the writer shows data printed on an egg with the following commentary 
<blockquote>&ldquo;When each egg has data stamped on it, we wonder how the type got there. Does each chicken have its own little rubber stamp? Or do all the eggs roll by a machine, which gently impresses onto that most breakable of surfaces? And do different sorts of eggs have different types on them? Brush Script for free-range[&hellip;] Copperplate for the expensive gourmet ones from geese and Helvetica for battery eggs?&rdquo;</blockquote>

Humour and character sprinkled throughout the text like this makes it a fun read. 

Jokes aside, the writers are incredibly good at explaining each topic and concept and making their points clear. I never felt confused or lost, not because there's a lack of technical info, but rather that info is transalated to non-type people very effectively. 

Analogies, frequent and consistant, are a big part of how this is achieved. There are a number of recurring analogies, usually running through a single chapter, that link each point the writer makes. Be ready to hear lots of talk of bands and choirs and orchestras as well as cars and freeways and driving. 

There's a phrase that pops up a few times in this book: 

<blockquote>&ldquo;There is no bad type.&rdquo;</blockquote>

When I first started learning about type, I was pursuing the "right" way to do things. I felt like everything I did was bad and that was due to me not knowing enough. While it's true that some design choices certainly work better than others, it all comes down to how appropriate a solution is to the task at hand. Page 41 has an exercise to assign typefaces to pictures of shoes. I really enjoyed this and liked how some of my answers differed from the writer's pairs. They go on to explain that there are any number of acceptable combinations and not one "right" answer. 

I hadn't heard anyone else share this mindset, I really like it.

Some typefaces discussed in the book also stood out to me:
- [FF SubMono by Eboys](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/ff-submono-font-fontfont/) - a very appealing pixel font
- [FF Xcreen](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/xcreen-font-fontfont) - font that's only 5x3 pixels while still being legible
- [FF Confidential](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/ff-confidential-font-fontfont/) - immediately recognised this as the font from the "You Wouldn't Steal a Car" anti-piracy advert

Slightly off-topic, but I really liked the example text used in the type demonstrations. The writers used snippets from [The Way to Wealth by Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_to_Wealth), which I've never read before, but thoroughly enjoyed. It's made me want to read more of his writings. Page 94 has a copy of this written using only icons and symbols which is very cool.

## My Least Favourites
Nearly every part of this book that I didn't enjoy purely came down to the content feeling outdated or redundant. I'm sure this isn't the case with the latest edition. 

Some noticable points that felt out of date:
- A key type consideration being to pick one that's not too light so it won't get lost when scanned by a photocopier, along with other guidance for fax machines and physical forms
- When talking about type on the web (pages 92 & 93), there is seemingly no appropriate design choices available besides line spacing. The use of italics is described as "*simply stupid*". However I really like how these pages look physically in print, the colours are pretty. 
- A number of references to the shift from CRT to LCD screens (page 121) 

Aside from content that didn't stand the test of time, I only have one other gripe: the attitude towards monospace fonts. 

On page 125 of the second edition, the writer states
<blockquote>&ldquo;There are only two reasons to still use monospaced fonts: to imitate the time-honored and personal look of the type-writers and to write plain text emails&rdquo;</blockquote>

This statement remains in the fourth edition (page 137), but is updated with a third reason: to write code.

Both editions further remark
<blockquote>&ldquo;Tree farms are to forests what monospaced fonts are to real type.&rdquo;</blockquote>

Maybe this is a matter of taste or maybe my inexperience is showing, but I'm a big fan of monospace type. At the time of writing this the body copy of this website is set monospaced (IBM Plex Mono). I've seen countless examples of monospaced type used to create both legible and beautiful designs. I felt the attitude towards monospace was a tad dismissive, like it couldn't be used for anything more than a gimmick or to meet technical needs. I would have enjoyed seeing some examples of typefaces or applications for monospaced type included, but maybe that's just me.


## Conclusion
An easy to ready, funny, accessible introduction to typography. A little bit dated in older editions, so [read the latest edition for free online](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/fonts.google.com/en//knowledge/stop_stealing_sheep.pdf). Or *do* read an older one - spend &pound;2 and also learn how designers worked with fax machines and photocopiers in mind :)
