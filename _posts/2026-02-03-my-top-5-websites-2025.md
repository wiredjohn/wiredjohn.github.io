Is it too late to still be talking about last year? Maybe it is, but I felt like pulling together a list of my top 5 website designs from 2025.  

This isn't anything serious so don't expect a trophy or anything. My criteria for consideration is:
- I found the website in 2025 (it wasn't necessarily created then)
- I like it


## Type Specimen Website for *Savate*

Link: [plombtype.com/savate](https://plombtype.com/savate/)<br />
Designer: [Max Esnée](https://max-esnee.com/)

*Savate* is an [open source font](https://github.com/maxesnee/savate) available on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Savate). The type specimen page was designed by (one of?) the creators of the typeface, Max Esnée.

The page is bright, playful and captures the essence of the typeface very well. I find the tin figurines and ceramic models incredibly cool and they add a dynamic depth and shine to an otherwise flat layout. (Aside: "Savate" is a French combat sport, hence all the boxing imagery)

I especially like the boxer figure in the splash section rotating on scroll, the blue and yellow colour combination and the fixed-position boxing glove animation.


## The Band *After*'s Website

Link: [after.band](https://www.after.band/)<br />
Designer: [bicflame](https://www.instagram.com/bicflame)

*After* are a pop-rock group with a very early-2000s look and sound. *bicflame* has created a site that perfectly reflects the style and overall brand identity of the band. 

I especially like the transitioning background animations, the white to blue linear gradients and the glossy/translucent buttons that are reminiscent of [Windows Aero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Aero).

Admittedly it's not a style for everyone, but for me this site is charming and refreshing. It's not just nostalgia-bait or another GeoCities revival, rather a modernisation of 2000's design trends that can still hold today.


## Type Specimen Website for *FIT*

Link: [djr.com/fit](https://djr.com/fit)<br />
Designer: [Chris Lewis](https://djr.com/fit#thanks) & [David Jonathan Ross](https://djr.com/about)

It's big. It's bold. It's climbing inside your retina. 

*FIT* is typeface by *David Jonathan Ross* and, in his own words, it was "designed with one thing in mind: filling up space with maximum impact".

The typeface does just that and so does the type specimen webpage. Designed by Chris Lewis, the page consists of massive, open sections that give the type room to dominate the space. The page is the perfect companion to a typeface designed to be huge and visually oppressive.

I especially like the subtle linear gradients in the red and black backgrounds, the choice of colour itself and the lack of design elements besides the typeface on display. 

The designer knew exactly what they were marketing.


## *PEOW2* Product Pages

Link: [peow.studio/shop/products/a-frog-in-the-fall](https://peow.studio/shop/products/a-frog-in-the-fall)<br />
Designer: [OHF dddd (digital division development department)](https://peow.studio/general-information)?

*Peow2* is a book publisher and online store, specialising in graphic novels and comic books. Their site structure, general layout and navigation are all unconventional and experimental (with varying degrees of success). I like the site overall but their product pages are particularly nice. 

Each product has it's own custom styled page with its own colour scheme, 3D models of the item, graphics, page scans and photographs. Every listing is tailored to the product, creating a sense of immersion that only grows as you navigate down the page. This is exactly what you want when trying to sell something.

When I initially wrote about Peow2 in my [December Recap](/2026/01/01/recap-december-2025#peow2-website), I complained about product pages not having an "Add to Cart" or "Buy Now" button - this has since been fixed. 

I especially like the product personalisation, the fixed-position elements around the corners, the big in-your-face imagery and 3D models.

I will definitely be keeping an eye out for new items being listed just to see what they do with the new product pages.


## Sharon Zheng's Personal Site

</video>

Link: [sharonzheng.com](https://sharonzheng.com/)<br />
Designer: [Sharon Zheng](https://www.instagram.com/sharon)

*Sharon Zheng* is a multimedia artist and creative technologist. Her personal site is fantastic in its impact and simplicity.

The site is structured like a nice, simple CV - but the page is wrapped in a 3D transform that distorts the text as it passes the top and bottom regions of the page. To me it looks like the page is made of paper and is getting fed through a spool as you scroll. Very cool. 

Perfectly executed simplicity. The site is clearly just to serve as a resume, but the clean layout, use of color and unique animation says without words that Zheng's a confident and competent designer.

Inspirational stuff.

## In Conclusion

There's lots of cool work out there that motivates me to be better at what I do. 

Putting this page together has been useful for me to understand what I myself find appealing about a webpage. For 2025, this was namely:
- 3D rotating stuff
- sections that occupy the full viewport
- striking colours
- bold typography
- fixed-position elements
- scroll interactivity (**without highjacking my input**)

This was fun. Let's hope there's another one for 2026.
